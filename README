= rubypodder - A podcast aggregator without an interface

This package contains rubypodder, a simple podcast receiver
inspired by bashpodder (http://linc.homeunix.org:8080/scripts/bashpodder/).

== Download

The latest version of rubypodder can be found at

   http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubypodder/

== Installation

Place the rubypodder gem in your local repository and install with
the following:

   gem install rubypodder

== Quick Start

Type

   rubypodder

When it finishes, you should see a ~/.rubypodder directory.
This should contain an example rp.conf configuration file with a feed in
it to get you started. If there were any podcasts to download in the feed
they will be in a directory named after the date (e.g. 2007-01-20).
You can see what happened by looking in rp.log.

== Running the rubypodder Test Suite

If you wish to run the unit tests that come with rubypodder:

   gem check rubypodder --test

A message will be given if any of the tests fail.

=== Uninstallation

To uninstall the rubypodder gem use:

   gem uninstall rubypodder

== Configuration

Create a file +~/.rubypodder/rp.conf+ containing podcast feeds, one per line.

== Usage

Type

   rubypodder

and if there are any podcast episodes from your feeds that have not yet
been downloaded, they will be downloaded into a "date" directory such as
+~/.rubypodder/2007-01-18/+

A good idea is to use +crontab -e+ and add a line like
+0 5 * * * rubypodder+
which will set up a cron job which will do
this regularly.

== License

rubypodder is available under an MIT-style license.
