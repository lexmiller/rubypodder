<h2>rubypodder</h2>

<h4>Overview</h4>

Rubypodder is a simple podcast aggregator inspired by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BashPodder">bashpodder</a>.
You configure it with all the podcasts (radio programmes, audio blogs,
etc.) that you regularly listen to. Then you run rubypodder as a cron
job and each morning before setting off, copy anything new onto your
mp3 player.<br>

<h4>Download and Installation</h4>

Note:&nbsp;ruby and rubygems must be installed on your computer. On
my Mandriva desktop, this would be:<br>

<pre># urpmi ruby rubygems rdoc</pre>

Download and install rubypodder:<br>

<pre># gem install rubypodder</pre>

<h4>Running rubypodder</h4>

Run rubypodder from the command line like this:<br>

<pre>$ rubypodder</pre>

Rubypodder comes with a default configuration file containing an
example podcast (the BBC comedy programme "The Now Show"). If there
were any episodes of this available you should see them in the
directory:<br>

<pre>~/.rubypodder/2007-01-27/</pre>

or whatever the date is when you run it. If there are no recent
episodes, you won't see the date directory but you should see:<br>

<pre>~/.rubypodder/rp.conf<br>~/.rubypodder/rp.log<br>~/.rubypodder/rp.done<br></pre>

<h4>Configuring rubypodder</h4>

You can edit rp.conf to put in the podcast feeds to which you wish to
subscribe. My configuration file looks like this:<br>

<pre>$ cat ~/.rubypodder/rp.conf<br>http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rmhttp/downloadtrial/radio1/radio1smusicinterviews/rss.xml<br>http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rmhttp/downloadtrial/radio4/inourtime/rss.xml<br>http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rmhttp/downloadtrial/worldservice/documentaryarchive/rss.xml<br>http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rmhttp/downloadtrial/sixmusic/talking6music/rss.xml<br>http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rmhttp/downloadtrial/radio4/thenowshow/rss.xml<br>http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rmhttp/downloadtrial/radio4/broadcastinghouse/rss.xml<br>http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rmhttp/downloadtrial/radio4/radio4choice/rss.xml<br>http://feeds.feedburner.com/rubyonrailspodcast<br>http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rmhttp/downloadtrial/radio1/radio1sentertainmentnews/rss.xml<br>http://www.guardian.co.uk/podcasts/comedy/rickygervais/mp3.xml<br>http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/podcast/channel-dwall.rss<br>$<br></pre>

You can set up rubypodder to run as a cron job. I set it up to run at
5am each morning. On my computer to do this you edit your crontab with:<br>

<pre>crontab -e</pre>

and add the line<br>

<pre>0 5 * * * rubypodder</pre>
